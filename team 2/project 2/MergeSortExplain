we use a  Divide and Conquer method to implement merge sort.
firstly we divide input array in two halves, calls itself for the two halves and then merges the two sorted halves using the merge function.

merge function:
fo this we have created a temp array to put the elements in it in sorted way by comparing the elements as both are already sorted.

merge sort function:
calling the function recursively on 1 half and again on the other half and then using the merge function to merge all the sorted arrays together.

the time complexity is O(n log n) for all the cases may it be best or worse.
the space complexity is O(n).
