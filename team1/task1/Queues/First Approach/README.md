## Costly - Push operation

Two Stacks used 
Stack is LIFO (last in - first out) data structure, in which elements are added and removed from the same end, called top.

### Analysis:
- enqueue: 
Time complexity - O(1)
Space Complexity -  O(1)
The new element is always added to the rear of queue q1 and it is kept as top stack element

- dequeue: 
Time Complexity - O(n)
Space Complexity - O(1)
